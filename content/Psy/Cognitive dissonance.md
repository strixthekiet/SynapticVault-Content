# Cognitive dissonance
### Description:
- When you find contradiction in your beliefs, ideals, values, and behaviours, you look for justification to make it make sense
### Forced compliance theory:
- Leon Festinger's experiment
	- About forced-compliance paradigm, in which the subject performed a series of repetitive and boring menial tasks
	- then was asked to lie to the “next subject” (actually an experimental accomplice) and say that the tasks were interesting and enjoyable. 
	- Some subjects were paid $1 for lying, while others were paid $20.
	- Subjects who were paid $1 for lying later evaluated the tasks as more enjoyable than those who were paid $20. 
	- The subjects who were paid $20 should not have experienced dissonance,
		- because they were well rewarded and had ample justification for lying, 
	- whereas those paid $1 had little justification for lying and should have experienced cognitive dissonance. 
	- They did not receive sufficient compensation for the lie they were asked to tell. 
	- Because of this insufficiency, the participants convinced themselves to believe that what they were doing was exciting. 
	- This way, they felt better about telling the next group of participants that it was exciting because, technically, they weren't lying.
