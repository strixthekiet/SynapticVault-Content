### Individual Rethinking (Part 1)
###### CHAPTER 1
- Rethinking is a mindset and a tool that is used to remove outdated facts
- There are 3 modes (Preacher, Prosecutor, and Politician) that we use instinctively which can prevent growth and learning
	- These 3 modes will be supported by at least 2 types of biases (**Confirmation bias** and **Desirability bias**)
- Scientist mode is a mode that uses a mindset of rethinking (adaptive ability)
	- Rethinking again and questioning yourself(our method)
		- searching for the truth based on hypotheses, experiments, and discover knowledge
	- Be flexible to change your mind

If the pros of knowledge is power, then the cons of it is that it closes us from a new perspective
