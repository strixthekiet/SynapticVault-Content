# Digital Logic Design
### Description:
- Deals with the design of digital circuits using logic gates, which are the building blocks of digital circuits. 
- These gates operate on binary signals, representing 0 and 1. Digital logic design involves specifying the logic of a circuit using Boolean algebra and other techniques.
