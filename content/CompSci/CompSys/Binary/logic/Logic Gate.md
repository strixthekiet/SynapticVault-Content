# Logic Gate
### Description:
- Logic gates are constructed by combining [[Transistor]]s in complementary arrangements
- Combinational circuit
### Typical Gates: 
- [[NOT Gate]]
- [[AND Gate]]
- [[OR Gate]]
- [[XOR Gate]]
- [[NAND Gate]]
- [[NOR Gate]]
- [[XNOR Gate]]
### Combinational Circuit:
- Multiple logic gates together where output of one is input of another
### Comparator:
- To compare 2 binary numbers with the same digit length, each of the digit from each number is compared in order

### [[Multiplexer]]
### [[Decoder]] vs [[Encoder]]
### Logic gate implementation from truth table:
1. Each output, write a gate, ex: 110=1 meaning A&B&C=1
2. Combine the gates
