# Field-Effect Transistor
### Description:
- [[Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor|CMOS]]
- There is constant power from one side and the gate decides if it allows electron to flow
![[states.png]]
### [[N Type]]:
- negative free-carriers (electrons)
- Open (0) by default, Closed (1) when there is electron from gate
### [[P Type]]:
- positive free-carriers (holes)
- Open (1) by default, Closed (0) and there will be electrons flow to gate
- Hint: the “**o**” bubble of the **p**-type tells you that this gate wants a **0** to be turned on
