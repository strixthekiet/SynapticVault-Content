# Time Complexity
### Description:
- Amount of time required by an algorithm to solve a given problem
### Estimate time complexity:
- Determine the number of primitive (basic) operations used in the algorithm
	- Primitive operations: Arithmetic operations, Logical operations, …
- Each primitive operation takes a constant time 𝑐 (independent of the input)
### Worse case analysis:
- $d=\text{max}_I⁡\{F(I)  \ \ | I \text{ is of size n}\}$
