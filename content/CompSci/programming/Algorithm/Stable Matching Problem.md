# Stable Matching Problem
### Description:
- The stable matching problem is about finding a way to pair elements from two different sets (e.g., men and women, students and colleges, residents and hospitals) where:
	- **Everyone is assigned a match:** Every element from one set has exactly one match in the other set.
	- **Stability is key:** 
		- a matching where no two elements would mutually prefer each other over their current assigned partners.
		- Meaning it can be improved
