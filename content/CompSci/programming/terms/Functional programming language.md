### Description:
- Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 
- Functional programming languages are often used for tasks that require a lot of data manipulation, such as scientific computing and web development. 
- Some examples of functional programming languages include Lisp, Haskell, and Erlang.
