# Software development methodology

### Description:
- Can organize sets of process decisions by how they address the common process steps
	- Formal vs. informal
		- Do steps have pre-defined outputs?
	- Duration and ordering
### Heavy-weight vs light-weight methodology:
- Heavy-weight
	- Better for bigger inter-related components
	- Fully complete (and document) each step before moving on
	- Avoid revisions to work done in previous steps
	- Processes and tools
	- Specifications
	- Following a plan
	- Client negotiation
- Light-weight
	- Better for uncertainty
	- Schedule work in “time boxes” that include multiple process steps
	- Avoid formal documentation to more easily accommodate changes
	- Individuals and interactions
	- Working software
	- Responding to change
	- Client collaboration
### Approaches:
- [[Iterative refinement model]]
- [[Incremental model]]
### Methodologies:
1. [[Waterfall model]]
2. [[Agile methodology]]
3. [[Scrum methodology]]
### Mixed processes
- Many projects mix elements of multiple methodologies  
- If requirements are well-understood, might use [[Waterfall model]] to define requirements & system design, then implement using [[Incremental model|Incremental Delivery]] performed in Scrum-like sprints  
- If requirements are vague, might use Iterative Refinement to clarify requirements, followed by Modified Waterfall to build final version (prototype is discarded)  
- Might Integrate & Configure a COTS platform for prototype  
- Might develop user interface with iterative refinement, but adopt another process for data store
