# Software development process
### Description:
- Essence of software engineering practice:
	1. Understand the problem (communication and analysis).
	2. Plan a solution (modeling and software design).
	3. Carry out the plan (code generation).
	4. Examine result for accuracy (testing & quality assurance)
### [[Software design pattern]]
### Engineering design process:
- ![[Engineering design process.png|400]] 
- Overview:
	- Feasibility & planning:
		- Define scope
		- Catalog benefits, risks
		- Evaluate technical feasibility
		- Select [[Software development methodology]]
		- Estimate cost, schedule, resources availability
		- Decide: go/no-go
	- Requirements:
		- User story
			- Independet
			- Negotiable
			- Valuable
			- Estimatable
			- Small
			- Testable
		- Define function of system from client's viewpoint ([[Functional requirement]])
		- Establish constraints ([[Non-functional requirement]])
		- Elicit from consultation with client, customer, users
			- Self-contained study or incremental
	- System & interface design
		- Select an architecture that supports requirements
		- User interfaces must be iteratively evaluated with users 
		- Architectural integrity is key to maintainable systems
	- Program development
		- May start with documenting program design (class & function definitions)
		- Coding!
		- May incorporate testing
	- Acceptance and release
		- Product is verified against requirements by the client
			- Ideally with selected customers & users
		- Complete system (with documentation) delivered to client
			- Deployed in production, marketed to customers
	- Operations and maintenance
		- System is kept running smoothly
		- Bugs discovered and fixed in production
		- New features proposed and integrated (requirements change)
		- May eventually be phased out
### Hooker's general principles:
1. The Reason It All Exists – provide value to users.
2. K I S S (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) – design simple as it can be.
3. Maintain the Vision – clear vision is essential.
4. What You Produce, Others Will Consume.
5. Be Open to the Future - do not design yourself into a corner.
6. Plan Ahead for Reuse – reduces cost and increases value.
7. Think! – placing thought before action produce results.
### Minimizing risk
- Minimizing miscommunication and delivering "wrong software" with:
	- Feasibility study
	- [[Requirement engineering]] and design
	- Milestones and releases
	- [[User accepting testing]]
### [[Software development methodology]]
### [[Critical path analysis]]
### [[Testing]]
### [[Service Level Agreement|SLA]]
### [[Project plan]]
