# Iterative refinement model
### Description:
- Developers can learn a lot about the domain and proposed design through prototyping  
- Process:  
	- Create a prototype early on  
	- Review prototype with clients; test prototype with users  
	- Clarify requirements, improve design (revise documentation)  
	- Refine prototype iteratively  
- Prototype is not a releasable product!  
	- Cannot evaluate non-functional requirements without final system design
- Each prototype should be formally evaluated, producing an evaluation report
- Medium-weight process  
- Documentation produced after each review, revised during iterations
