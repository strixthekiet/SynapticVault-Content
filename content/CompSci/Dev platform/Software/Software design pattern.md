# Software design pattern
### Description:
- Treat an architecture of a specific system as:
	- a collection of computational components
	- a description of interactions between these components.
- Graphically speaking,
	- Nodes represent the components
	- Arcs represent the connectors (procedure call, event broadcast, database queries, and pipes, etc.)
- Set of constraints on how these elements can be combined. E.g., no cycles
