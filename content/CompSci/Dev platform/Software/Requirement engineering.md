# Requirement engineering
### Description:
- The process of establishing the services that a customer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed. 
- The system requirements are the descriptions of the system services and constraints that are generated during the requirements engineering process.
- It may range from a high-level abstract statement of a service or of a system constraint to a detailed mathematical functional specification.   
- This is inevitable as requirements may serve a dual function 
	- May be the basis for a bid for a contract - therefore must be open to interpretation;
	- May be the basis for the contract itself - therefore must be defined in detail;
### Types of requirements
- User vs system requirement
	- Business requirement
		- [[Key Performance Indicator]]
	- User requirements 
		- Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. 
		- Written for customers. 
	- System requirements 
		- A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints. 
		- Defines what should be implemented so may be part of a contract between client and contractor.
- [[Functional requirement|Functional]] vs [[Non-functional requirement]]
- [[Domain requirement]]
### Requirement engineering processes:

- Requirement elicitation:
	- Sometimes called requirements elicitation or requirements discovery. 
	- Involves technical staff working with customers to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide and the system’s operational constraints. 
	- May involve end-users, managers, engineers involved in maintenance, domain experts, trade unions, etc. These are called stakeholders.
	- Software engineers work with a range of system stakeholders to find out about the application domain, the services that the system should provide, the required system performance, hardware constraints, other systems, etc. 
	- Stages include: 
		- Requirements discovery, 
		- Requirements classification and organization, 
		- Requirements prioritization and negotiation, 
		- Requirements specification.
