# Artificial Intelligence
### Description:
- As a subdomain of computer science, the field of artificial intelligence deals with the automation of behavior and machine learning. 
- It essentially implies simulating human intelligence and learning, i.e. by collecting information and finding rules for using that information.
- Computers are programmed to solve problems and complete tasks in a relatively independent manner by combining data science, processing power, and algorithms.
- There are many categories but most or all of AI are trained with [[Machine learning|ML]]
### Categories:
1. Speech recognition and natural language processing: how to process speech (auditory input) and language  
2. Computer Vision: how to process visual input  
3. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: how to represent the world and reason about it efficiently  
4. [[Machine learning]]: how to get better with experience  
5. Planning and Reinforcement Learning: how to take actions over a long time horizon  
6. Robotics: how to build a physical system that embodies intelligent behavior.
