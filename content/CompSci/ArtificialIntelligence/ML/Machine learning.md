# Machine Learning

### Description:
- Learn and improve from "experience" **without emperically programmed**
- Data-driven
	- mostly "structured". 
- Once the training phase is over, the adaptive machines can apply their findings to real cases and make predictions, for example. If a machine learning algorithm produces inaccurate assertions, data engineers intervene and make adjustments or corrections.

### Types of machine learning method:
- [[Supervised learning]]
	- [[Classification model]]
	- [[Regression Model]]
- [[Unsupervised learning]]
	- no label
	- [[Large Language Model]]
- [[Semi-supervised learning]]
- [[Reinforcement learning]]
	- with experience by interacting with the environment
	- s


[[Deep Learning]]
