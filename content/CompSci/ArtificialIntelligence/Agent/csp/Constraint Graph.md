# Constraint Graph
### Description:
- A state (as a node) contains n number of variable where each is assigned a value
### Binary CSP: 
- each constrain related to (at most) 2 variables (represent with an arc)
- Binary Constraint graph: 
	- nodes are the variables, arc shows constaints between nodes
### Search Methods for Constraint Graph:
- Uninformed Search:
	- BFS and DFS might be applicable but ..?
	- [[Backtracking Search]]
