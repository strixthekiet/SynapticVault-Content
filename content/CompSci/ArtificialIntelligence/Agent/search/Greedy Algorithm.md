# Greedy Algorithm
### Description:
- In all the current node, expand the node that has the lowest [[Heuristic Function|heuristic]]
- Worst case: it can be a badly-guided [[Depth First Search|DFS]]
- Used for finding:
	- [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]
	- [[Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm]] 
	- [[Travelling Salesman Problem]]
	- [[Huffman Coding]]
### Few examples:
- [[Coin Changing Problem]]
- [[Interval Scheduling Problem]]
- [[Interval Partitioning Problem]]
- [[Minimize Lateness Problem]]
