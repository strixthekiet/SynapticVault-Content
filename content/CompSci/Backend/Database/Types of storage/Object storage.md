# Object storage
### Description:
- Computer data storage approach that manages data as "blobs" or "objects", as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manages data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.
- These objects are stored in a packaged format which contains the binary form of the actual data itself, as well as relevant associated meta-data (such as date created, author, resource type, and permissions), and a globally unique identifier.
- Object storage systems allow retention of massive amounts of unstructured data in which data is written once and read once (or many times)
