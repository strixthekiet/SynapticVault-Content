# GCP Deployment Manager
### Description:
- Uses templates from [[GCP Marketplace]] written in a combination of YAML, python, and Jinja2 to automate the allocation of Google Cloud resources and perform setup tasks. 
- Behind the scenes a virtual machine has been created. 
- A startup script was used to install and configure software, and network Firewall Rules were created to allow traffic to the service.
