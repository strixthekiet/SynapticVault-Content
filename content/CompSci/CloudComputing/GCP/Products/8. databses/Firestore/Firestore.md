- Billing charged for each document read, write, and delete that you perform with Firestore.
	- Has 50k reads, 20k write, 20k deletes, 1gb of data for free per day
- The db reference caches data that an app is actively using, so the app can write, read, listen to, and query data even if the device is offline.
	- When the device comes back online, Firestore synchronizes any local changes back to Firestore. 
- Automatic multi region replication
- Pays per read/write
### Native mode vs Datastore mode
- Next gen of [[GCP Datastore]]
- Datastore
	- real time updates in mobile and web client library features are not.
	- For server project
- Native:
	- compatitble with all datatore
	- Firestore can operate in datastore mode, so its backward compatible
### ACID transaction?
