# GCP Carrier Peering
### Description:
- Using [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] to establish physical connection to Gcloud
- Packages sent to the ISP that is Google partner then sent to Google
- Run [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] or use static routing over that link
- Instead of setting up and maintaining a perimeter network, the organization can work with a service provider so that their traffic travels on a dedicated link from their systems to Google. With the dedicated link, the organization gets a higher availability and lower latency connection to Google's network.
