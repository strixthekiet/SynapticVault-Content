# CaaS, Containers as a service
### Description:
- Delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop and deploy applications using [[Container|container]]. 
- Developers and IT operations teams can use CaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform to run and manage containers. 
- Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy containerized apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.
