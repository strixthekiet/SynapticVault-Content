# Azure Tenant
### Description:
- Represents a single organization. 
- Also called a **directory**
- An Azure _tenant_ is a single dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID. 
- When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, a new tenant is automatically created. 
- Because each tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID, you can create multiple tenants or instances.
