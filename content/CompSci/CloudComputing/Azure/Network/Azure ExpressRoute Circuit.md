# Azure ExpressRoute Circuit
### Description:
- Extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection thru a connectivity provider.
- This allows you to connect offices, datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud. Each location would have its own ExpressRoute circuit.
- can enable ExpressRoute Global Reach to exchange data across your on-premises sites by connecting your ExpressRoute circuits.
- uses the [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]]. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing between your on-premises network and services running in the Microsoft cloud.
