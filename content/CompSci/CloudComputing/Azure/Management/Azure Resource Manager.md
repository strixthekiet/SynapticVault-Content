### Azure Resource Manager locks:
- allow organizations to put a structure in place that prevents the accidental deletion of resources in Azure.
	- You can associate the lock with a subscription, resource group, or resource.
	- Locks are inherited by child resources.
- There are two types of resource locks.
	- **Read-Only locks**, which prevent any changes to the resource.
	- **Delete locks**, which prevent deletion.
