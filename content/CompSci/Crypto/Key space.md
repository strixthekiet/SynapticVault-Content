# Key space
### Description:
- refers to the set of all possible keys that can be used to encrypt or decrypt messages within a given cryptographic system.
- It determines the number of unique ways to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. 
- A larger key space provides greater security, as it increases the computational difficulty for an unauthorized party to determine the correct key and decrypt the message.
