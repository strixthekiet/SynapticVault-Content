# Vector Linear Independence
### Description:
- A collection $x^(1), . . . , x^(m)$ of vectors in a vector space $X$ is said to be **linearly independent** if no vector in the collection can be expressed as a [[Linear Combination]] of the others. 
	- ie,  $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i x^{(i)}=0\implies \forall \alpha_i =0$ 
		- because there is no way for 1 vector to go to another vector as they are parallel
	- meaning the linear combination of them is always 0
- They are linearly dependence, otherwise, if one vector doesnt help expanding the **span** of the collection of vectors
