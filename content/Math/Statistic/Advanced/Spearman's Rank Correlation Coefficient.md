# Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient
### Description:
- Used to measure the correlation between the order or rank of two variables.  
- $\displaystyle R = 1 − \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}$ 
	- where $n$ is the number of pairs of data
	- $d_i$ is the difference between the rankings in each set of data. ($|supposed-real|$)
- The value of $R$ can be interpreted in exactly the same way as the ordinary correlation coefficient
- $−1 ≤ R ≤ 1$
