# Regression Model
### Description:
- An equation that describes how $y$ is related to $x$ and an error term $\epsilon$ 
### Testing for significance:
- Coefficient of determination ($r^2$) is a measure of the goodness of fit of the estimated regression equation. 
- However, even with a large value of $r^2$, the estimated regression equation should not be used until further analysis of the appropriateness of the assumed model has been conducted.  
- An important step in determining whether the assumed model is appropriate involves testing for the significance of the relationship. 
- The tests of significance in regression analysis are based on the following assumptions about the error term $\epsilon$
