# Sample mean, $\bar X_n$
### Description:
- Some what [[Expected value|expected value]] of  a sample
-  $\displaystyle \bar X=\sum\limits^n_{i=1}\frac{X_i}{n}$
- Proof:
	- Let $X_1, . . . , X_n$ be independent and identically distributed random variables having distribution function $F$ and expected value Âµ. 
	- Such a sequence of random variables is said to constitute a sample from the distribution $F$. 
	- Or different combination of observations of the same distribution is also a sample
	- Then the quantity $\displaystyle \bar X=\sum\limits^n_{i=1}\frac{X_i}{n}$
- $E[\bar X]=\mu$, mean of [[Sample mean|sample mean]] is the [[Population mean|population mean]] ^2dac95
### Variance of sample mean: $\displaystyle\color{tomato} Var(\bar X)=\frac{\sigma^2}n$
