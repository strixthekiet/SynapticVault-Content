# Strong law of large numbers
### Description:
- States that the average of a sample will, with probability 1, converge to the mean of that distribution.  
- Let $X_1, X_2, . . .$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having a finite mean $μ = E [X_i ]$. 
	- Then, with probability 1,  $\displaystyle \frac{X_1 + · · · + X_n}n → μ$ as $n → ∞$
