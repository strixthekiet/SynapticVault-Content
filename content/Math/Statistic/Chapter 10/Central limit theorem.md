# Central limit theorem
### Description:
- Based on [[Weak law of large numbers]]
- Let $X_1, X_2, . . .$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having finite mean $E [X_i ] = μ$. 
	- Then the distribution of any [[Sample]], $\displaystyle \frac{X_1 +... + X_n -n.\mu}{\sigma\sqrt n}$ tends to ==standard normal distribution== as $n → ∞$  
- A good rule of thumb for a good approximation is when $n$ is 30
	- but when the sd is larger, we need more n to ensure
