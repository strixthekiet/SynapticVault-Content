# Limit theorems
### Description:
- [[Markov's inequality]]
- [[Chebyshev's inequality]]
- [[Central limit theorem]]
- [[Law of large number]]
### Practical interpretation:
- Suppose a random variable $X$ has mean $μ$ and standard deviation $σ$. Then:
- Sum of observations, $S_n = X_1 + · · · + X_n$ has mean $n.μ$ and standard deviation $σ\sqrt n$
- Sample mean, $\displaystyle \bar X_ n = \frac{X_1 + · · · + X_n}{n}$  has mean $μ$ and standard deviation $\frac{σ}{\sqrt n}$  
- If $X$ is normally distributed, then $X_n$ and $S_n$ are normally distributed for any $n$
- If $X$ is not normally distributed, $X_n$ and $S_n$ are approximately normally distributed provided $n$ is sufficiently large.
