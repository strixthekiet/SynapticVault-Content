# t-distribution
### Description:
- From a [[Sample]]
- Based on [[Distribution of sample mean]]
- For ==unknown== standard deviation
- In most applications, a sample size of $n â‰¥ 30$ is adequate to use this expression
- Interval estimation: $\displaystyle \bar x\pm{\color{tomato} t_{\alpha/2}}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$
	- $s$ is sample standard deviation
	- $1-\alpha$ is the **confidence coefficient**
	- where $t_{\alpha/2}$ is $z$ with $n-1$ degree of freedom
### Degree of freedom:
