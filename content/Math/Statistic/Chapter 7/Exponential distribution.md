# Exponential distribution

## Description:
- [[Continuous random variable]]
- Describes the time between events that occur randomly and independently at a constant average rate. the number of occurrence in a timeframe is $\lambda$
- It is often used to model waiting times, such as the time it takes for a customer to be served at a checkout counter or the time it takes for a website to load.
### Probability density function:
- For some $\lambda>0$ by $f(x)=\begin{cases} {\color{tomato}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}} &\text{for } x\ge 0 \\ 0 &\text{for } x<0 \end{cases}$

- $X\sim Exp(1/8)$

## Expected value $E[X]=\frac{1}{\lambda}$

## Variance $Var(X)=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}$
## Cumulative distribution function:
- $$F(a)=P(X\le a)={\color{tomato}1-e^{-\lambda a}}, \ \ a\ge 0$$

## [[Hazard rate function]] 
- Suppose now that the lifetime distribution is ==exponential==
- Then, by the memory-less property, it follows that the distribution of remaining life for a $t-$year-old item is the same as that for a new item.
- Hence, λ(t) should be constant. In fact, this checks out, since $$λ(t) = \frac{f(t)}{\bar F(t)}=\frac{λe^{−λt}}{e^{−λt}} = λ$$ ^ca9e8d
- Thus, the failure rate function for the exponential distribution is ==constant==.
