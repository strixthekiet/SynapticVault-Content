# Time Series Trend
### Description:
- A continous long-term movement over time in the values recorded
	- Upward, downward vs horizontal
### Methods to find a trend:
- Inspection: 
	- The trend line can be drawn by eye on a graph in such a way that it appears to lie evenly between the recorded points, that is, a line of best fit drawn by eye.  
- [[Regression Model|Regression Analysis]]: 
	- This method makes the assumption that the trend line is a straight line. 
	- Periods of time are numbered, and the regression line of the data on those periods is found. 
	- That line is taken to be the trend.  
-  [[Moving Average]]: 
	- This method attempts to remove seasonal variations by a process of averaging.
