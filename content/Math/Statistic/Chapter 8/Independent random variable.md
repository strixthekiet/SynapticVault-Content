# Independent variable
### Description:
- The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be independent if, for any two sets of real numbers $A$ and $B$, $P{X ∈ A, Y ∈ B} = P{X ∈ A}P{Y ∈ B}$
- In other words, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if, for all $A$ and $B$,  
- the events ${X ∈ A}$ and ${Y ∈ B}$ are independent.  
- It will follow if and only if, for all $a$ and $b$ $P{X ≤ a, Y ≤ b} = P{X ≤ a}P{Y ≤ b}$
- In terms of the joint distribution function, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if $F (a, b) = F_X (a)F_Y (b)$ for all $a, b$
