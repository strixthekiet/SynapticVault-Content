# Jointly distributed random variable
### Description:
- For any two random variables $X$ and $Y$, which will make up a new random variable of different distribution with distinct observations consists of both $X$ and $Y$
	- ==Unlike related variable==, where observations of the same distribution is added
- For both discrete and continuous
### Inequality between jointly random variable:
- $\displaystyle P(X_{1}<X_{2})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{X^{2}}f(x_1,x_2)dx_{1}dx_{2}$
- $\displaystyle P(\frac{X_{1}}{X_{2}}<Z)\to P(Z<a)=P(\frac{X_{1}}{X_{2}}<a)=P(X_{1}<aX_{2})=\int_{X_{2}^{l}}^{\infty}\int_{X_{1}^{l}}^{aX_{2}}f(x_1,x_2)dx_{1}dx_{2}$
