# Chi-squared distribution: $\chi^2$
### Description:
- The chi-squared distribution often arises in practice as the distribution of the error involved in attempting to hit a target in n-dimensional space when each coordinate error is normally  distributed.  
- If $Z_{1} , Z_{2} , . . . , Z_{n}$ are independent standard normal random variables, then $Y= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} Z_{i}^{2}$ is said to have the chi-squared distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom.
