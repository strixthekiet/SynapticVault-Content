# Joint cumulative distribution function
### Description:
- [[Cumulative distribution function]] for [[Jointly distributed random variable]] 
- We define Joint cumulative probability distribution function of $X$ and $Y$ by:$$F(a,b)=P\{X\le a,Y\le b\} \ \ \ \ \ -\infty<a,b<\infty$$
- All joint probability statements can be answered in terms of joint distribution function $P(a_{1} <X\le a_{2},b_{1}<Y\le b_{2})=F(a_{2},b_{2})-F(a_{1},b_{2})-F(a_{2},b_{1})+F(a_{1},b_{1})$
