# Descriptive statistic
- Pie chart:
	- A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.
	- In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.
- Bar chart:
	- A bar chart is a chart of rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally.
	- A simple bar chart is a chart in which the length of each bar indicates the magnitude of the corresponding data item.
	- A component bar chart is a bar chart that gives a breakdown of each total into its component.
- Frequency distribution:
	- A frequency distribution records the number of times each value occurs.
	- Grouped frequency distribution: If there is a larger set of data or if data item is different, it is often convenient to group frequencies together in bands or classes.
	- Cumulative frequency distribution: A cumulative distribution can be used to show the total number of times that a value above or below a certain amount occurs.
- Histograms:
	- A histogram is the pictorial representation of a frequency distribution.
	- Histograms look like vertical bar charts, except that the bars are joined together.
- Averages:
	- Arithmetic means:
		- the arithmetic mean is calculated from the sum of values of items divided by the number of items. The arithmetic mean of a variable x is denoted by Ì„x.
	- Mode:
		- The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data.
	- Median:
		- The median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half.
- Dispersion and skewness of data:
	- The range:
		- The range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and smallest values
	- Percentiles:
		- A percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
	- Quartiles:
	- Interquartile
	- Deciles:
		- A decile is any of the nine values that divide the sorted data into ten equal parts, so that each part represents 10% of the sample or population.
	- Variance:
		- The average of squared mean deviation for each value in a distribution.
			- $\displaystyle \sigma^2=\frac{\sum^n_{i=1} (x-\bar x)^2}{n}$
			- $\displaystyle \sigma^2=\frac{\sum fM^2-n\bar x^2}{n}$
				- where $f$ is the class frequency and $M$ is the class midpoint
	- Standard deviation:
		- square root of the variance
	- [[Skewness]]
