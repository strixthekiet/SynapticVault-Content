# Sampling and data
### [[Descriptive statistic]]

## Data:
- ==Data== are values of qualitative (attributes) or quantitative (variable) from observations
- It is an abstract concept that can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived

## Statistic:
- A statistic is a number that represents a property of the ==sample==.
- The ==statistic== is an estimate of a population ==parameter==. 

## Parameter:
- A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the ==whole [[Population]]== that can be estimated by a statistic.

## An attribute:
- a characteristic of an object which ==cannot== be measured.
	- example: he is tall

## Variable:
- something that may or does vary which can be measured
- A discrete variable:
	- a variable which can only take a countable number of values.
- Continuous variables:
	- may take on any value.

## Census vs [[Sample]] survey:
- Census refers to data collection about everyone or everything in a [[Population]].
	- This method gives a high degree of accuracy but is very expensive and time consuming.
- Sample survey:
	- Only part of total population is used for collecting data.
		- This method is less expensive than a census and the results can be obtained far more quickly.
	- But the results have a degree of inaccuracy, depending on the sample size and methods for conducting survey.

## Types of errors:
- [[Sampling error]]
- [[Response error]]
- [[Non-response error]] occur when the survey fails to get a response to one, or possibly all, of the questions.

## A [[Simple random sample]] is a sample selected in such a way that every item in the population has an equal chance of being included.

## A sampling frame is the source material from which a sample is drawn. It is a list of all those within a population who can be sampled.
- A sampling frame should have the following characteristics:
	- Completeness
	- Accuracy
	- Up to date
	- Non-duplication
- Drawbacks of random sampling:
	- An unrepresentative sample may result.
	- The members of population selected may be scattered over a wide area.

## [[Systematic sampling]]

## There are more sampling method

| Random sampling method | Desc |
| ---- | ---- |
| Simple random | All item has equal chance |
| Quasi-random | includes: Systematic, Stratified, and Multistage sampling |
| Systematic | pick every kth item where k=population size/sample size |
| Stratified | stratum sample size = (size of stratum)ร(sample size)รท(size population) then use another method to selects elements from each stratum |
| Multistage | At each stage, a stratified random sample on a variable on which they could get information before sampling |


| Non-random sampling method | Desc |
| ---- | ---- |
| Quota | select a predetermined number or proportion of units with specific characteristics in a non-random manner |
| Cluster | the total population is divided into groups (or clusters) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected |
