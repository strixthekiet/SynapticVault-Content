# Undirected
### Description:
- All edges are undirected
### Handshaking theorem:
- Let $𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸)$ be an undirected graph with 𝑚 edges. 
- Then  $\displaystyle 2m = \Sigma_{v\in V}\text{deg}(𝑣)$
- Also applies even if multiple edges and loops are present.
- Theorem:
	- An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree #Math/discrete/graph/theorem
