# Matching
### Description:
- $M$, a subset $\in E$ such that no vertex in 𝑉 is on more than one edge in 𝑀
	- i.e. one $V$ has maximum one edge
### Perfect matching:
- Every vertex in $V$ is on an edge in $M$
### Maximum matching:
- Largest possible of $|M|$
- [[Hall's Marriage Theorem]] can be used to find
### Complete matching:
- $M$ such that every nodes in $V_1$ is matched (assumed $|V_1|\le |V_2|$)
- A complete match is a maximum match
### [[Stable Matching Problem]]
