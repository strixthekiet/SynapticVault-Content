# Chromatic Number, $\chi(G)$
### Description:
- The least number of colors needed for a coloring of a graph.
- Denoted by $\chi(G)$
### Some coloring boundings:
- An even length closed cycle is 2-colorable
	- $\chi(C_{even})=2$
- An odd-length closed cycle requires 3 colors
	- $\chi(C_{odd})=3$
- A complete graph $K_n$ requires $n$ colors: $\chi(K_n )=n$
- All bipartite graph is 2-colorable:Â  $\chi(K_{(m,n)} )=2$
