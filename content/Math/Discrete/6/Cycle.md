# Cycle
### Description:
- A circuit, a path where $n ‚â• 1$ and $v_0=v_n$ (i.e., **starts and ends at the same vertex**)
- The length of the cycle is ùëõ (i.e., the number of edges). 
- Notes:
	- A cycle is called simple (or closed walk) if it does not contain the same edge more than once.  
	- For undirected graphs, we are more interested in cycles that use each edge at most once.  
	- A directed graph without cycles is called a DAG (a directed acyclic graph).  
	- An undirected graph without cycles is called a tree 
	- A cycle must at least have length 1 (a self loop)
