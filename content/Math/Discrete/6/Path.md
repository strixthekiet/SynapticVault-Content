# Path
### Description:
- A path that returns to the starting node is a [[Cycle]]
- A sequence of [[Vertex|vertices]] $(v_0,v_1,...,v_n)$ such that there exists an edge between any two consecutive vertices $e_j=(v_{i-1},v_i)\in E$ for $0<i\le n$.
- Travels the edges $e_1,...,e_n$
- The length of the path is the number of edges
- Notes:
	- Simple path: doesn't contian the same edge more than once
	- On an undirected graph, every path is "reversible"
	- A path can have length 0, self-loop
