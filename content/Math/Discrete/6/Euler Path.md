# Euler Path
### Description:
- A path that uses every [[Edge]] in a graph exactly once
- 2 nodes with odd degrees will be the starting and ending path
### Theorems:
- A undirected graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸) has an Euler path, but not a [[Euler Cycle]], if and only if the graph is connected and exactly two nodes has an odd degree. #Math/discrete/graph/theorem
