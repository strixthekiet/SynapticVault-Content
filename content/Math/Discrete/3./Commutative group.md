# Commutative group
### Description:
- A commutative group, also known as an Abelian group, is a group in which the group operation is commutative. 
- This means that the order in which two group elements are combined does not affect the result. 
- In other words, for any two elements a and b of the group, we have a∘b=b∘a.
