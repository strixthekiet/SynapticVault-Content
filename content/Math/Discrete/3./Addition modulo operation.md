# Addition modulo operation
### Description:
- $a +_m b = (a + b) \mod m$
- denoted by $+_m$ 
- The operations $+_m$ satisfies many of the same properties of ordinary addition of integers.  
	1. Closure: If $a$ and $b$ belong to $\mathbb Z_m$, then $a +_m b$ belongs to $\mathbb Zm$.  
	2. Associativity: If $a, b,$ and $c$ belong to $\mathbb Zm$, then $(a +_m b) +_m c = a +_m (b +_m c)$
	3. Commutativity: If $a$ and $b$ belong to $\mathbb Zm$, then $a +_m b = b +_m a$
	4. Identity element: The element 0 is identity element for addition modulo m. That is, if a belongs to $\mathbb Zm$, then $a +_m 0 = 0 +_m a = a$. 
	5. Additive inverses: If $a \not= 0$ belongs to $\mathbb Zm$, then $m − a$ is an additive inverse of a modulo m and 0 is its own additive inverse. That is, $a +_m (m − a) = 0$ and $0 +_m 0 = 0$
- $\mathbb Z_m$ with modular addition is said to be a [[Commutative group]]
