# Divisibility
### Description:
- Let $a, b ∈ Z$ with $a \not= 0$. We say that $a$ divides $b$, denoted by $a|b$, if there exists some  $k ∈ Z$ such that $b = ak$
- In equation, $a=dq+r$
	- $a$ is called the ==dividend==
	- $d$ is called the ==divisor==
	- $q$ is the ==quotient==
		- $q=a\text{ div } d$
	- $r$ is the ==remainder==
		- $r= a\mod d$
### Theorems:
- Let $a,b,c\in \mathbb Z$:
	1. If $a|b$ and $a|c$ then $a|(b+c)$ #Math/discrete/theorem 
	2. If $a|b$ then $a|bc$ #Math/discrete/theorem 
	3. If $a|b$ and $b|c$ then $a|c$ (i.e, transitivity) #Math/discrete/theorem 
- Division algorithm: #Math/discrete/theorem 
	- For any $a\in \mathbb Z$ and $d\in \mathbb N^+$, there exist ==unique== $q,r \in \mathbb Z$ such that:
		- $a=dq+r$
		- and $0\le r< d$
