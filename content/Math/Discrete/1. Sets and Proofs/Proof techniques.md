# Proof techniques

### Definitions:
 1. A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms #Math/discrete/definition 
 2. A proposition is a statement (communication) that is either true or false #Math/discrete/definition 
 3. A predicate can be understood as a “proposition” whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables. #Math/discrete/definition 
 4. Axioms are propositions that are simply accepted as truth ( doesnt need to be proved, might not be able to) #Math/discrete/definition 
 5. A proof is a sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in question #Math/discrete/definition 
 6. Propositions of the form “If P, then Q” are called implications. This implication is often rephrased as “P implies Q.” #Math/discrete/definition
