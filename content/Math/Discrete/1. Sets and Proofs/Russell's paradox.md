# Russell's paradox
### Description:
- A set defined as $R=\{ S|S\not\in S \}$: 
	- R is set of all sets, S, that dont contain themself as an element
- is R a set? R is not a set or a collection
- $S\in \{ x|x\in U,... \}$ is always a set where $U=E\cup\mathcal{P}(E)\cup \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(E))\cup...$ but we only care a set as a subset of $U$
