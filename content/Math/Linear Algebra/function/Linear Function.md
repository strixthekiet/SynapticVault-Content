# Linear Function
### Description:
- It is a vector function that has function $f(x)=a^Tx$
	- for $f\ : \ \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb R$ with $a\in \mathbb R^n$
- Vector $a$ can be viewed as a linear **map**
- 
### 
- It is a vector function that has function $f(x)=a^Tx+b$
	- for $f\ : \ \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb R$ with $a\in \mathbb R^n$ and $b\in \mathbb B$ 
	- and $a,b$ are independent
- We can obtain $a$ and $b$:
	- $a(i)=f(e_i)-b$ for $i=1,...n$
	- $b=f(0)$
