# First Order Taylor Approximation
### Description:
- A linear function that approximates a differentiable function near a given point by using its value and gradient at that point.
- Useful for **simplifying complex functions** and **estimating their behavior** around a point of interest.
- $f(x)\approx f(x_{0})+\nabla f(x_{0})^{T}(x-x_{0})+\mathbf{H.O.T.}$
