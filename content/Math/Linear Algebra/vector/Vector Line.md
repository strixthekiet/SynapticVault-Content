# Vector Line
### Description:
- The [[Span]] of a single [[Vector]], $v\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the set $Span(v):=\{av:a\in \mathbb{R}\}$
	- A line pass thru the origin with direction $v$
- More generally, for $x^0,v\in \mathbb{R}^n$, the set  $Span(v, x^0):=\{x^0+av:a\in \mathbb{R}\}$ is the line of direction $v$ that passes through $x^0$
