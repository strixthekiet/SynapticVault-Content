# Subspace
### Description:
- The possible position vector occupied by $n$ vectors by a [[Linear Combination]]
- In $R^3$, 2 independent vectors have subspace of $R^2$
- [[Vector Space]] is a subspace of its self
### Properties:
- Contains the origin
- Closure under addition and scalar multiplication:
	- A nonempty subset, $V$ of a [[Vector Space]] $\chi$ if for any scalars, $\alpha, \beta: x,y\in V\implies \alpha x+\beta y\in V$ 
	- A nonempty subset, $V$ of a [[Vector Space]] $\chi$ if for any scalars, $\alpha, \beta: x,y\in V\implies \alpha x*\beta y\in V$
