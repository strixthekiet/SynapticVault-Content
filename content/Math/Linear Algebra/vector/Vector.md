# Vector
### Description:
- Collection of number in 1 column
- Can represent:
	- A point in space in $n$-dimension
	- A direction
	- A linear function
	- Time series
- Has [[Scalar Product]]
- Has [[Euclidean Length]]
	- $||x||$ denotes the length of the vector
- Has components:
	- $x(i)$ denotes the $i$-th component of vector $x$
### Vector Transformation:
- Transpose, $^T$:
	- Transform column-vector $x$ to row format
	- $x^T=[x_1 \ \ x_2 \ \ ...\ \ x_n ]$ 
	- $x^{TT}=x$
